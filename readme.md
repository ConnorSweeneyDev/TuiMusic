# TuiMusic
A terminal-based music player written using SDL, FTXUI and TagLib. It features:
- Pause/Unpause
- Seek
- Skip
- Volume Up/Down
- Search
- Playlists
- Shuffle
- Per-Song Volume Normalization Around -14dB
- Persistent State

## Usage
Playlists are in the form of folders on your filesystem - place absolute paths to folders in the `user/playlists.txt`
directory and the player will load them on startup. The player will start playing a random song from the first playlist
and will continue to pick random songs from that playlist after it finishes playing the current one. If you manually
change the playlist the player will start playing a random song from the new playlist instead. After adding a new MP3
file to an existing folder, you should run the player with the `-r` flag to re-cache the playlists and pick up the new
song.
